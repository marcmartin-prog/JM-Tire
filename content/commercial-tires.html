        <p class="light small regular">Long haul steer tires have several distinct characteristics to make them the best option for over the road steer position applications. They have a decoupling groove on the shoulder to fight uneven shoulder wear and cupping. They boast innovative tread compounds to insure the best fuel economy and the longest wear.</p>
        <p class="light small regular">Regional steer tires for applications such as agricultural trucks, school buses, delivery services, construction worksites, or any application that requires more braking, turning, or off-road driving. They boast cut, chip rubber compounds to withstand a harsher environment and have extra sidewall protection for curbing. These tires do not usually have a decoupling groove. </p>

      <div class="">
        <p class="light small regular">Closed shoulder drive tires are the normal pick for over the road, long haul, fleet service. The closed shoulder gives them more stability, better fuel mileage, and longer, more even wear. These tires are not the best choice when greater traction is needed.</p>
        <p class="light small regular">Open shoulder drive tires are all about traction. They are built in many different designs to deliver the characteristics the application demands. Models such as the Michelin XDN2, Cooper Work Series AWD, and Hankook DL12 are designed to deliver excellent on highway winter traction without compromising tread life and even wear. More aggressive tires are a good choice for applications that require off-road Mud and Snow traction, or higher cut and chip

    <h3>Trailer Tires</h3>

      <div class="">
        <p class="light small regular">Trailer tires should be matched to application as well. Long haul trailer tires are designed with fuel efficiency and even wear in mind to give fleets the lowest cost per mile. On spread axle or higher scrub applications, these tires don’t stand a chance. Usually, an all position tire will perform the best in these applications. Deeper tread, more rounded design, more durable tread compounds, make these the tires of choice for spread axle, step deck, hopper bottom, low boy, or any other application where the trailer is going off of pavement.</p>
